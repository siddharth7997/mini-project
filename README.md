#spellchecker
In this project we are using associative array to load various dictionary words and based on the type of language choosen the respective dictionary is loaded.
works in 5 different languages.


#GroupMailingSystem:
In this you can need to upload a text file containing the email ids and then it can send the mail to all the people's mail ids mentioned in the file.The core idea is to use smtp object and sending mail to anyone via our email id.
It works same as the Way2sms.com
The basic use can be to spam anyone and any no of people as long you have their email id and a message to spam them.
